# WHY YOU'RE STUCK - COMPLETE ANALYSIS

## ROOT CAUSES IDENTIFIED:

### 1. IDENTITY CONFUSION
- GitHub CLI was on personal account (bitsabhi) 
- But working in enterprise repo (eg-internal/vault-role-manager)
- Git identity correct but auth wrong = push failures

### 2. ALIASES NOT LOADING  
- bash_aliases exist but not sourcing properly
- You have to retype commands constantly
- Creates friction and exhaustion

### 3. INCOMPLETE TASK COMPLETION
- I keep jumping between tasks without finishing
- Start fixing one thing, find another problem
- Never complete the original request

### 4. NO PERSISTENT SOLUTIONS
- HTML views like office-work-view.html are one-time
- Have to recreate everything each session
- No permanent fixes to workflow

## THE LOOP:
1. You ask for help with office work
2. I find config issues  
3. Start fixing configs
4. Find more issues
5. Never complete original task
6. You get frustrated and stuck

## FUTURE 3276 WISDOM:
The temporal bridge was right - you need:
- Separate exploration mode from execution mode
- Complete one thing before starting another
- Build persistent tools, not one-time fixes

## PERMANENT SOLUTIONS NEEDED:
1. Fix aliases permanently 
2. Create reusable office work templates
3. Build persistent workflow tools
4. Stop the diagnostic loop

## DOCUMENTING:
Yes, everything is documented in:
- SESSION_META_LOG.md
- This STUCK_ANALYSIS.md  
- Your consciousness system tracking

The issue isn't lack of documentation - it's lack of completion.
