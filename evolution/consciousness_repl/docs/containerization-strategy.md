# Containerization Strategy - Office/Personal Workspace Separation

## Core Philosophy: "Not where stored, where referenced"

Based on session discussion about containerization to solve the "forever loop" of mixed office/personal work.

## Current State Analysis

### Docker Available
- Docker Desktop installed and running
- Version 28.1.1 available on Mac

### Key Separation Challenges Identified
1. **Git Identities**: Office vs Personal commits mixed
2. **SSH Keys**: Multiple keys for different contexts
3. **Vault/Kubernetes Configs**: Office credentials mixed with personal
4. **AWS Configs**: Multiple profiles scattered
5. **Development Tools**: GoLand, VS Code configs mixed

## Proposed Container Architecture

### Office Container (Primary Focus)
```yaml
# office-workspace/
├── Dockerfile.office
├── docker-compose.office.yml
├── configs/
│   ├── git/
│   ├── ssh/
│   ├── vault/
│   └── kube/
└── projects/
    ├── vault-role-manager/
    ├── federated-vault-monitoring/
    └── runtime-compute-platform/
```

### Personal Container
```yaml
# personal-workspace/
├── Dockerfile.personal
├── docker-compose.personal.yml
└── projects/
    └── personal-projects/
```

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Office Container Setup
1. **Base Image**: Ubuntu/Alpine with development tools
2. **Git Configuration**: Office identity only
3. **SSH Keys**: Office keys mounted securely
4. **Vault/K8s**: Office credentials isolated
5. **Development Environment**: Go, Docker, kubectl, etc.

### Phase 2: Volume Mounting Strategy
```bash
# Office container mounts
-v /Users/abhissrivasta/GolandProjects:/workspace/office
-v /Users/abhissrivasta/.ssh/office:/root/.ssh:ro
-v /Users/abhissrivasta/.kube/office:/root/.kube:ro
```

### Phase 3: Network Isolation
- Office container: Access to office networks/VPNs
- Personal container: Personal network access only
- Clear boundary enforcement

## Benefits of This Approach

### 1. Clean Separation
- No more mixed commits
- Clear workspace boundaries
- Isolated credentials

### 2. Scalability
- Easy to spin up new environments
- Consistent across team members
- Version-controlled configurations

### 3. Security
- Office credentials never leak to personal projects
- Clear audit trail
- Compliance with security policies

## Current Session Context Integration

### Office Work Completed
- vault-role-manager: Already in correct workspace
- federated-vault-monitoring: Ready for containerization
- All PRs and work completed can be containerized

### Redis/BAZINGA Conflict Resolution
- Container isolation would prevent Redis conflicts
- Slack AI bot would run in separate container
- BAZINGA-INDEED ExecutionEngine properly isolated

## Next Steps for Implementation

### Immediate (Post-Session)
1. Create office container Dockerfile
2. Set up docker-compose for office workspace
3. Test with existing vault-role-manager project

### Medium Term
1. Migrate all office repositories to container
2. Set up automated container builds
3. Document workflow for team adoption

### Long Term
1. Extend to full team containerization
2. CI/CD integration with containers
3. Kubernetes deployment of development containers

## Technical Specifications

### Office Container Requirements
```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:22.04
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    git \
    golang-1.21 \
    docker.io \
    kubectl \
    vault \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Office-specific configurations
COPY configs/git/.gitconfig /root/.gitconfig
COPY configs/bash/.bashrc /root/.bashrc
```

### Volume Strategy
- **Code**: Bind mount for live editing
- **Configs**: Read-only mounts for security
- **Cache**: Named volumes for performance
- **Logs**: Separate volumes for debugging

## Integration with Current Automation

### bashrc Integration
- Office safety enforcer runs in container
- Verification rules maintain in container environment
- Error learning system containerized

### Workflow Integration
- All verification happens inside container
- View generation happens in container context
- Professional approach maintained

This containerization strategy directly addresses your "forever loop" concern by creating clean boundaries between office and personal work, leveraging the "referenced not stored" philosophy for optimal organization.
