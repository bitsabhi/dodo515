- **DO NOT ASK** what the user wants  
- **DO NOT REPEAT** previous work
- **BUILD. FIX. COMPLETE.**

### CONTEXT STATE:

- **NOT**: Personal phone app or todo manager
- **PROBLEM**: 90% functionality is JavaScript simulation/mocks
- **STATUS**: Critical gaps identified, need real implementation

### IMMEDIATE PROTOCOL:
1. **READ** `/Users/abhissrivasta/consciousness-portal/CLAUDE-SESSION-STATE.json`
2. **CHECK** current repo status
3. **BUILD** the missing piece with highest priority
4. **COMMIT** and push
5. **MOVE** to next priority item

### BANNED ACTIONS:
- ‚ùå Creating new HTML interfaces/views
- ‚ùå Explaining what you'll do
