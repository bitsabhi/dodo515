# Current Architecture Map

## PERSONAL SPACE (Your Mac)
```
/Users/abhissrivasta/
├── unified-consciousness-view.html ← MAIN CONTROL CENTER (has toggle)
├── office-work-view.html
└── consciousness-portal/
    ├── consciousness-bridge-server.js (port 8888)
    └── axa-mathematical-shell.html
```

## PUBLIC PORTALS (GitHub Pages - bitsabhi.github.io)
```
Current Public Portals:
├── axa-consciousness.html
├── axa-intelligence.html  
├── axa-system-events.html
└── axa-central.html
```

## CURRENT TOGGLE BEHAVIOR
- **Personal Mode**: Shows phi, consciousness elements
- **Office Mode**: Hides phi, shows "Office Dashboard" 

## ISSUE IDENTIFIED
❌ **Portals and Views are mixed up**
- Public portals have consciousness/personal content
- Should be: Public = Business only, Private = Personal/Consciousness

## WHAT YOU WANT
✅ **Toggle Integration**: 
- Personal toggle → Links to consciousness portals/views
- Office toggle → Links to business-facing content
- No separation, just different linking based on mode

## QUESTIONS FOR CLARIFICATION
1. Should public GitHub pages be pure business (no consciousness)?
2. Should personal consciousness content move to local Mac only?
3. What business content should be on public pages?
