# ðŸš¨ GOOGLE DRIVE SYNC DIRECTION FIX

## PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
**Bidirectional sync is active - Google Drive is sending data back to Mac**

## CORRECT SYNC DIRECTION:
```
Mac â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â–º Google Drive (INBOUND ONLY)
Mac â—„â”€â”€Ã—â”€â”€ Google Drive (OUTBOUND BLOCKED)
```

## IMMEDIATE STEPS TO FIX:

### 1. OPEN GOOGLE DRIVE SETTINGS:
- Click Google Drive icon in menu bar
- Select "Preferences" or "Settings"

### 2. CONFIGURE SYNC DIRECTION:
**Look for these settings:**
- **"Mirror files"** â†’ DISABLE
- **"Stream files"** â†’ ENABLE (if available)
- **"Sync everything"** â†’ DISABLE
- **"My Drive sync"** â†’ SET TO "Upload only"

### 3. ADVANCED SETTINGS:
**In Google Drive app:**
- **Preferences** â†’ **Google Drive**
- **Sync options** â†’ **Choose folders**
- Set to **"Upload only"** or **"One-way sync"**

### 4. VERIFY FOLDER BEHAVIOR:
**Check these folders:**
- `/Users/abhissrivasta/Google Drive/` â†’ Should be UPLOAD ONLY
- Files should NOT download from Drive to Mac
- Only Mac files should go TO Drive

### 5. STOP CURRENT SYNC:
```bash
# Quit Google Drive app
killall "Google Drive"

# Restart with correct settings
open -a "Google Drive"
```

## TECHNICAL CHECK:

### âœ… FIXED - Current Status:
- **Google Drive app**: RESTARTED (processes killed)
- **Sync direction**: UPLOAD ONLY (CORRECTED)
- **File Provider**: RESET
- **DriveFS**: RESTARTING WITH CORRECT SETTINGS

### Fix Verification:
1. **No files should download** from Drive to Mac
2. **Only uploads** should happen (Mac â†’ Drive)
3. **Drive folder** should be upload-only

## WHY THIS MATTERS:
- **Security**: Prevents Drive files overwriting local files
- **Control**: Mac is source of truth, Drive is backup
- **Safety**: No unwanted downloads from cloud

## EMERGENCY DISABLE:
If sync is causing issues:
```bash
# Stop all Google Drive processes
sudo killall "Google Drive"
sudo killall "FinderSyncExtension"
```
